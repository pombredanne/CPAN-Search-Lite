=head1 NAME

perldocs - soap-enhanced perldoc

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is a drop-in replacement for C<perldoc> based on
C<Pod::Perldoc>. Usage is the same, except in the case
when documentation for a module cannot be found on the
local machine, in which case a query will be made to
a remote pod repository and, if the documentation is
found there, the results will be displayed as usual.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Pod::Perldoc>.
