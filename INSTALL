Installation of the Perl modules follows the standard
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

A mysql database should be created manually. Two generic users
should be created - one, with access to create, drop, insert, 
query, and update tables in the database, and another, for
just querying the tables. Before creating the database, you
may want to set
   ft_min_word_len=3
in your my.cnf file (and restart the server), so that words 
of a minimum length of 3 (eg, "net" and "ftp") are indexed.

Creating, and subsequently updating the database, is controlled
through the use of the csl_index script in the bin/ subdirectory.
The various options needed to set up the database, including the
name, password, and database name to be used, are specified through
a configuration file. Once this is set up,
   perl csl_index --config /path/to/csl_config.conf --setup
will initially create and populate the needed tables, after which
   perl csl_index --config /path/to/csl_config.conf
will update it. See the embedded pod documentation for details.

A number of example interfaces for querying the database are included:

- bin/csl_query   - a script for local queries
- bin/csl_soap    - a script for soap-based queries; the server is
                    found as cgi-bin/soap.cgi
- bin/perldocs    - a soap-enhanced perldoc; the server is found as
                    as cgi-bin/docserver.cgi, and the required
                    module as lib/Pod/Perldocs.pm (requires Pod::Perldoc).
- cgi-bin/search  - a cgi script
- mod_perl        - two mod_perl-2 modules, Apache::CPAN::Search and
                    Apache::CPAN::Query, for a mod_perl interface

For the cgi-bin and mod_perl interfaces, example Template-Toolkit
pages are included in the tt2/ and tt2-alt/ subdirectories. Note
that these scripts, the mod_perl modules, and the tt2 pages will
require manual editing for urls reflecting the local server, the 
location of the tt2 pages, and the username, password, and name of 
the database to be used when connecting to the database for 
performing queries. See the embedded pod docs for details.

In the htdocs/ directory there are some files: faq.html, for some
faqs, dslip.html, for some information on the dslip entry in the
information for packages, style.css, a css style file, and ppm.html,
for some information on using ppm on Win32.

Support is available for different languages (based on the
preference set in the browser). Translations of some terms
occurs within CPAN::Search::Lite::Lang, while the remainder
occurs within the tt2 pages. The structure of these pages is
  tt2/config
  tt2/header
  tt2/footer
  tt2/mirror_list
which are files common to all languages (translation occurs
via data structures passed in through CPAN::Search::Lite::Lang),
while the langage specific pages are under
  tt2/fr/mirror
  ...
  tt2/de/mirror
  ...
and so on. The default language used is "en" (English), if
the user's preference isn't available.
