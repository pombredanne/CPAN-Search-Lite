    - fix bug where an error message, for example, in a regular
      expression query was getting cached across requests.
    - introduce presentation of results in different languages,
      based on the language preference of the web browser.
      This entails some changes in the config/header/footer tt2
      pages, as well as provision of the rest of the pages in
      a translated form.
    - introduce stemming (from Text::English) when doing a text
      search of the module/distribution abstracts; this is an
      experiment to see if better search results are obtained.

    - add custom Apache2 configuration directives for
      mod_perl 2 based modules, rather than having to edit
      the files
    - add mod_perl 2 SOAP-based services (requires Apache2::SOAP,
      which is a mod_perl 2 aware version of Apache::SOAP of the
      SOAP-Lite distribution), and provide examples within
      bin/csl_soap and bin/perldocs.

    - add perldocs, a soap-enhanced Pod::Perldoc to fetch from
      remote repository modules pods not available on local system.

    - when calling CPAN::Search::Lite::Query->new(), accept as an argument
      max_results => $max_results, specifying the maximum number
      of results to return.
    - fix a bug where $max_results was being applied to more than
      just user queries (which it now does).
    - move declaration of Template::Toolkit object to a package
      variable in the mod_perl handlers, so as to cache it.
    - move declaration of CPAN::Search::Lite::Query object to
      a package variable in the mod_perl handlers, so as to cache it.

    - ensure the labelled INSTALL and README files for a distribution
      are not possible .pm files.
    - add a fix_links method to Populate.pm to fix the links in the
      generated html files. The reason for this is that when the html
      file are created no cache is used, to maintain consistency between
      updates, and so links to packages outside a given package may
      be wrong. This method queries the database to see what module
      docs are really present, and asjusts the links accordingly
      (or removes them, if they're not present).

    - direct to main page if query term is empty
    - various checks to avoid warnings about uninitialized
      hash elements
    - documentation fixes
