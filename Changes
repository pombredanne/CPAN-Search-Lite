    - various translation improvements
         French: Isabelle Hernandez <isa at panix.com>
         German: Florian Greb <greb at inf.fu-berlin.de>
         Italian: Enrico Sorcinelli <bepi at modperl.it>
         Spanish: Joaquin Ferrero <explorer at joaquinferrero.com>
    - add script to automatically generate dslip.html information
      page in different languages, contributed by Briac Pilpre
      <briac at pilpre.com>)
    - add checks of Apache::Test, SOAP::Lite, mod_perl, and
      libapreq2 in Makefile.PL, which are optional modules in principle,
      but needed to run various web services for the database.
    - split the modules into a lib/ and Apache2/ directory,
      so as to be able to run "Test" tests under lib/ and
      "Apache::Test" tests under Apache2/.
    - add a test suite, which requires a "test" database (of user
     "test") already set up, plus Apache::Test to test web services.
    - add a simple configuration script to set up the configuration
      file used by csl_index to create and update the database,
      as well as some sample Apache directives.
    - for the Apache directives to set up the database connection,
      interpret the lack of a password directive to mean no password
      is required.
    - for a search term of a module or distribution which results
      in one match, supply the "subletter" information.
    - remove some leading and trailing spaces in the information
      gathered from the CPAN indices for author full names and
      chapter ids.
    - in the example Apache directives, indicate that CPAN ids
      can contain numbers, as well as letters and the '-' sign.
    - when a distribution is scheduled for deletion from the
      database, remove it's pod and html docs as well, if present.

    - use AI::Categorizer to guess at a category for unassigned
      modules/distributions, based on the learning from existing
      categorized modules. There are two new options available
      in the [CPAN] section of the configuration file:
         - cat_threshold: a number between 0 and 1 used as a threshold
           for assigning categories
         - no_cat: to not use this feature
    - bump up length of module names stored in the mods table,
      as some modules were longer than this
    - if there is only one result available for a link from a "letter"
      page of modules/distributions or a chapter page, redirect to
      that page directly, rather than show a page with one link
    - present the date and file size associated with distributions
      in different languages
    - (greatly) improved translations:

      Thanks!
    - add ppminfo.cgi, a soap server script now used by PPM::Make
      to get module/distribution/author info.
    - switch to Lingua::Stem for the stemming algorithm used
      in the text searches

    - fix bug where an error message, for example, in a regular
      expression query was getting cached across requests.
    - introduce presentation of results in different languages,
      based on the language preference of the web browser.
      This entails some changes in the config/header/footer tt2
      pages, as well as provision of the rest of the pages in
      a translated form.
    - introduce stemming (from Text::English) when doing a text
      search of the module/distribution abstracts; this is an
      experiment to see if better search results are obtained.

June 14, 2004 - 0.47
    - fix bug in Query.pm to return an array if requested.

June 2, 2004 - 0.46
    - fix bug where some updates weren't being recorded properly
      when they involved a change in module author

April 15, 2004 - 0.45
    - add custom Apache2 configuration directives for
      mod_perl 2 based modules, rather than having to edit
      the files
    - add mod_perl 2 SOAP-based services (requires Apache2::SOAP,
      which is a mod_perl 2 aware version of Apache::SOAP of the
      SOAP-Lite distribution), and provide examples within
      bin/csl_soap and bin/perldocs.

March 19, 2004 - 0.25
    - add perldocs, a soap-enhanced Pod::Perldoc to fetch from
      remote repository modules pods not available on local system.

    - when calling CPAN::Search::Lite::Query->new(), accept as an argument
      max_results => $max_results, specifying the maximum number
      of results to return.
    - fix a bug where $max_results was being applied to more than
      just user queries (which it now does).
    - move declaration of Template::Toolkit object to a package
      variable in the mod_perl handlers, so as to cache it.
    - move declaration of CPAN::Search::Lite::Query object to
      a package variable in the mod_perl handlers, so as to cache it.

March 10, 2004 - 0.20
    - ensure the labelled INSTALL and README files for a distribution
      are not possible .pm files.
    - add a fix_links method to Populate.pm to fix the links in the
      generated html files. The reason for this is that when the html
      file are created no cache is used, to maintain consistency between
      updates, and so links to packages outside a given package may
      be wrong. This method queries the database to see what module
      docs are really present, and asjusts the links accordingly
      (or removes them, if they're not present).

    - trim whitespace from query term, and remove quotes and
      backslashes
    - verify presence of table id before updating tables
    - check for validity of regular expression query term
    - direct to main page if query term is empty
    - various checks to avoid warnings about uninitialized
      hash elements
    - documentation fixes

    - initial release
